# To use this file, make a copy named MPICH_RANK_ORDER, and set the
# environment variable MPICH_RANK_REORDER_METHOD to 3 prior to
# executing the program.
#
# The following rank order was generated with the command:
#
#   grid_order -R -P -m 512 -n 128 -g 8x8x8 -c 8x4x1 -N 128
#
# Option -N does not provide router optimization because the
# first cell dimension (8) is larger than half the
# corresponding grid dimension (8).
